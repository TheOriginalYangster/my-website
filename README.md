# About
This is a personal website I am making that will eventually be hosted on www.williamsimoneyang.com.
I purchaced a template from <a href="https://elements.envato.com">Elements Evanto</a> and am editing it to fit my needs.

# Icons
I am using <a href="https://konpa.github.io/devicon/">DEVICON</a> for the icons in my 'skills' section.
These are really neat and I highly reccomend trying them out if you're making a programming portfolio website.

# To-Do
The Contact Me and Send a Message forms do not work and need to be fixed.
Fix up images and working links to past projects.
