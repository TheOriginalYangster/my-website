# About
This is a personal website I am making/updating that is hosted on www.williamsimoneyang.com.
I purchaced a template from <a href="https://elements.envato.com">Elements Evanto</a> and am editing it to fit my needs.

# IT
I obtained the domain from Google Domains and am hosting the site using HostGator.  I configured the domain to redirect to my HostGator site IP address.  HTTPS should be enabled by EOD July 12th 2019.

# Icons
I am using <a href="https://konpa.github.io/devicon/">DEVICON</a> for the icons in my 'skills' section.
These are really neat and I highly reccomend trying them out if you're making a programming portfolio website.

# To-Do
The Contact Me and Send a Message forms do not work and need to be fixed. <br>
Fix up images and working links to past projects. <br>
Ensure HTTPS is working. <br>
Get new icon for iPhone link preview.  Flavicon is too low-res.
